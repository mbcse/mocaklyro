Klyro is a builder discovery and scoring platform designed to help hackathon organizers, Web3 communities, and airdrop teams find real builders with verifiable proof of work—all in one place.

We started with a simple idea: there’s no easy way to discover actual contributors in Web3. GitHub alone doesn’t tell the whole story, and wallet activity without context is just noise. So we built Klyro to bridge that gap.

With Klyro, **organizers can spin up customizable registration forms**—just like Google Forms—but instead of collecting just names and emails, they ask for a GitHub handle and wallet address. Once a participant submits, Klyro automatically **analyzes their full builder footprint**.

We go beyond surface-level tracking. Klyro pulls together data from multiple sources and deeply analyzes:

- Open source Web3 contributions  
- Active smart contracts they’ve deployed  
- TVL in those contracts  
- Number of unique users interacting with their work  
- GitHub code activity and engagement  
- Code quality and Lines of code written
- Hackathons they’ve participated in or won  
- Overall project ecosystem contributions  

All this happens across multiple chains, which organizers can filter too!!!

From all of this, we generate a comprehensive builder score and a shareable on-chain resume that showcases the builder’s real skills and achievements—backed by verifiable, public data.

This score isn’t inflated or gamified. **We’ve intentionally designed the scoring to be rigorous, rewarding impact over vanity**. Builders who ship real code, deploy live contracts, and solve meaningful problems get recognized.

On the organizer’s side, Klyro makes it incredibly simple to:

- View rich, ranked profiles of all applicants  
- Filter and shortlist based on real data  
- Send automated acceptance or rejection emails  
- Export data or plug into your workflows  

No more spending hours manually vetting GitHub profiles or checking if wallets are real. Klyro does it all—instantly.

We launched just yesterday and have already onboarded 100+ builders in less than 24 hours, all organic.

And this is just the beginning.

**We’re expanding Klyro beyond just developers**. Next up: scoring systems for Web3 marketers and creators—people who grow communities, create content, drive adoption, and contribute in non-technical but equally vital ways.

Our vision is to become the talent layer for Web3—a unified, verifiable, and trusted platform where anyone can showcase their work, and any community or project can discover the right contributors with proof, not promises.

**With Klyro, communities can grow smarter, airdrops can be fairer, and builders finally get the recognition they deserve**.

We also have a Farcaster mini app https://miniapp.klyro.dev/
